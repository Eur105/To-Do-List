# To-Do-List
The JavaScript-based To-Do List Application is an interactive task management tool designed for efficiency and ease of use. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it allows users to add, update, and delete tasks while organizing them in a structured table format with serial numbers indicating priority. Users can enter task details such as time frame, title, and description, with an auto-suggestion feature providing smart recommendations. The application supports clearing all tasks at once for quick list resets and ensures data persistence using local storage. With a responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile use, this project demonstrates my ability to create functional and user-friendly web applications with a focus on seamless interactions and intuitive design.
